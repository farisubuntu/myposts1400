# Full PHP 8 Tutorial

## 23 - [PHP Function Parameters - Named Arguments - Variadic Functions & Unpacking](https://www.youtube.com/watchv=I9XkWyets9w)

- Variadic Functions (`token `...`)
    - data type must be before `&` reference if present.
     `function f1(int &...$arg)`
- Unpacking operator `...$variable` **vs** array: thats when an array or trabversable of arguments, then unpacked it to be passed to a function tn the  form of an argument list.

Compare :

```php
var_dump(hash_alogs());
echo "<hr>";
var_dump(...hash_alogs());
```

## 24 - [PHP PHP Variable Scopes - Static Variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et1aVZWMvVE&list=PLr3d3QYzkw2xabQRUpcZ_IBk9W50M9pe-&index=24)

_**Other Sources:**_

## [Variables From External Sources](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.external.php#language.variables.external)

> Variable Scope: The scope of a variable is the context within which it is defined.

PHP has three different variable scopes:

- local
- global
- static

```php
// index.php
$a = 1; // Here the $a variable will be available 
          // within the included f1.php script.
include 'f1.php';
$b = 2000;
var_dump($v1); // 1000`
```

```php
// f1.php
$v1=1000;
var_dump($a); // 1
var_dump($b); // warning, undefined variable within f1.php
```
 
> Any variable used inside a function is by default limited to the local function scope including static variables.

### ways to access `global` variables:

1. global variables MUST be declared `global` inside a function if they are going to be used in that function and then every references outside will refers to the global variable.
2. Using `$GLOBALS` *supper global* Array instead of `global` keyword:

```php
$a = 100;
function f1(){
 var_dump(GLOBALS['a']+50); // int(150)
}
```

> Using global keyword outside a function is not an error. It can be used if the file is included from inside a function.

## Static variable/function

A static variable exists only in a **local function scope**, but it does not lose its value when program execution leaves this scope. 

Static variables also provide one way to deal with recursive functions.
A recursive function is one which calls itself.

```php
function foo(){
    static $int = 0;          // correct 
    static $int = 1+2;        // correct
    static $int = sqrt(121);  // wrong  (as it is a function)

    $int++;
    echo $int;
}
```


As of PHP 8.1.0, when a method using static variables is inherited (but not overridden), the inherited method will now share static variables with the parent method. This means that static variables in methods now behave the same way as static properties. 
For Example:

```php
class Foo {
    public static function counter() {
        static $counter = 0;
        $counter++;
        return $counter;
    }
}
class Bar extends Foo {}
var_dump(Foo::counter()); // int(1)
var_dump(Foo::counter()); // int(2)
var_dump(Bar::counter()); // int(3), prior to PHP 8.1.0 int(1)
var_dump(Bar::counter()); // int(4), prior to PHP 8.1.0 int(2)
```

> `echo` has no return value while `print` has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions.

> To delete a variable manually, use `unset($var)`

> Unlike Java and C++, variables declared inside blocks such as loops or if's, will also be recognized and accessible outside of the block.

**Notes:**

The PHP superglobal variables are: [w3schools.com](https://w3schools.com)

    $GLOBALS
    $_SERVER
    $_REQUEST
    $_POST
    $_GET
    $_FILES
    $_ENV
    $_COOKIE
    $_SESSION

`$GLOBALS[index]` is a *super global* associative array contain a references to ALL variables currently defined in the global scope of the script. `index` holds the name of the variable.

## PHP Built-in Functions

PHP has over 1000 built-in functions that can be called directly, from within a script, to perform a specific task. [Click here to discover it](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_overview.asp)

> PHP is a Loosely Typed Language- means no need to declare variables types but in PHP >=7 you have it as option and by adding the `strict` decleration it will throw a "Fatal Error" if type mismatches.

To specify `strict`, set `declare(strict_types=1);` which must be on the very first line of the PHP file.


`range(low, high, step)`:This function returns an array of elements from low to high. If the low parameter is higher than the high parameter, the range array will be from high to low.

```php
range(0,50,10); //0,10,20,30,40,50
range("a","h",2); //a,c,e,g
```

## [Variable Variable](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.variable.php)

example:

```php
// variable of variable: variable that use another variable's value as its name, for 
$a = 'hello';
// variable variable:
$$a='world'; // At this point two variables have been defined and stored in the PHP symbol tree: $a with contents "hello" and $hello with contents "world"

// But
echo "$a {$$a}"; // processed exactly like ' echo "$a $hello" '
```

### Chapter 11: References

- Assign by ref: two variables share the same value BUT don't point to one another. They point to the same place ('value').

```php
$foo = &$bar;
$foo = 'hi';
$bar = array(1, 2); //assign by reference within the array() language construct.
$array = array(&$foo, &$bar[0]); // refs inside arrays - dangerous
```


---


## Chapter 13: Array iteration

- `array_map` is the simplest way (when two arrays with same length)

```php
// two arrays of the same length need to be iterated together
$people = ['Tim', 'Tony', 'Turanga'];
$foods = ['chicken', 'beef', 'slurm'];
// HERE: use array_map and regular/anynoumus function

//....

// what about 'array_combine($arr1,$arr2)' 

```
