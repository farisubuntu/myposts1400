## Create React App

if `Service-worker` needed

```shell
$ npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-pwa
```

### Storybook

to see UI components states, you can add Storybook for React (source) or React Styleguidist (source) to your project. These are third-party tools that let you develop components and see all their **states** **in isolation from your app** without need to backend server [Storybook Site](https://storybook.js.org/)

To get **Storybook**, inside your directoyr:

```shell
npx -p @storybook/cli sb init
```

After that, follow the instructions on the screen.

### Styleguidist


**Styleguidist** combines a style guide, where all your components are presented on a single page with their props documentation and usage examples, with an environment for developing components in isolation, similar to Storybook. In Styleguidist you write examples in Markdown, where each code snippet is rendered as a live editable playground.
First, install Styleguidist:

```shell
npm install --save react-styleguidist
```

Then, add scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
   "scripts": {
+    "styleguide": "styleguidist server",
+    "styleguide:build": "styleguidist build",
     "start": "react-scripts start",
```

You may require the dev server to serve pages over HTTPS. To do this set the HTTPS environment variable to true, then start the dev server as usual with `npm start`:

```bash
HTTPS=true npm start
```

## Adding Styles/Assets

if `webpack` used for handling all assets then you can:

```css
/* Button.css */
Button {
  padding: 20px;
}
```

```js
// Button.js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import "./Button.css"; // Tell webpack that Button.js uses these styles

class Button extends Component {
  render() {
    // You can use them as regular CSS styles
    return <div className="Button" />;
  }
}

/* Notes:
- this is not required for React but useful.
- In development, expressing dependencies this way allows your
+ styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In
+ production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single
+ minified `.css` file in the build output.
*/
```

### CSS Modules Stylesheet

CSS Modules (with file name convention: `[name].module.css`) let you use the same CSS class name in different files without worrying about naming clashes.

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import styles from "./Button.module.css"; // Import css modules stylesheet as styles
import "./another-stylesheet.css"; // Import regular stylesheet
```

### export/import

```js
//---------
// exporter.js 
//---------

// Named exports
export function f() {return "exported Func() ...."}
export const one = 1;

// Default exports
export default function defaultFun(return "default Fun()...") {}
//---------
// importer.js 
//---------

// Default import
import F from './exporter.js';
console.log(F());// default Fun()...

import {F} from 'exporter.js'
console.log(F()); // exported Func() ....
console.log(one); // 'one' is not defined
```

### Module systems created prior to ES6:

Prior to ECMAScript 6, JavaScript did not have built-in modules. Two popular ones are:

see: [cs6 cheatsheet.md](../javascript/es6_cheatsheet.md)

### Why should we use CSS Modules?

With CSS Modules, it’s a guarantee that all the styles for a single component:

1. Live in one place
2. Only apply to that component and nothing else


---
### The `composes` keyword

For Example:

```css
.serif-font {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
}
.display {
  composes: serif-font;
  font-size: 30px;
  line-height: 35px;
}
```

We would declare one of those classes in our template like so:

```js
import type from "./type.css";

element.innerHTML = `<h1 class="${type.display}">
    This is a heading
  </h1>`;
```

---

### Adding Images, Fonts and Files

With webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.

You can import a file right in a JavaScript module. This tells webpack to include that file in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing a file gives you a **string value**. For Example:

```js
import React from "react";
import logo from "./logo.png"; // Tell webpack this JS file uses this image

console.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png

function Header() {
  // Import result is the URL of your image
  return <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />;
}

export default Header;
```

> webpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with ./) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle.

#### Adding SVG

One way to add SVG files was described in the section above. You can also import SVGs directly as React components. You can use either of the two approaches. In your code it would look like this:

```js
import { ReactComponent as Logo } from "./logo.svg";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Logo is an actual React component */}
      <Logo />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Using Public Folder

- contianing the HTML files
- setting page title
- If you put a file into the public folder, it will not be processed by **webpack**. Instead it will be copied into the build folder untouched.
- To reference assets in the public folder:

```js
<link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
//  Only files inside the public folder will be accessible by %PUBLIC_URL% prefix.
```

## When to Use the `public` Folder[​](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-the-public-folder#when-to-use-the-public-folder "Direct link to heading")

Normally we recommend importing [stylesheets](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-stylesheet), [images, and fonts](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files) from JavaScript. The `public` folder is useful as a workaround for a number of less common cases:

- You need a file with a specific name in the build output, such as [`manifest.webmanifest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).
- You have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths.
- You want to include a small script like [`pace.js`](https://github.com/CodeByZach/pace) outside of the bundled code.
- Some libraries may be incompatible with webpack and you have no other option but to include it as a `<script>` tag.

### Importing a Component

```js
// Button.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Button extends Component {
  render() {
    // ...
  }
}

export default Button; // Don’t forget to use export default!

// DangerButton.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Button from './Button'; // Import a component from another file

class DangerButton extends Component {
  render() {
    return <Button color="red" />;
  }
}

export default DangerButton;
```

> Be aware of the [difference between default and named exports](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/react-native-es-6-when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-import/36796281#36796281). It is a common source of mistakes.

### Using Global Variable

When you include a script in the HTML file that defines global variables and try to use one of these variables in the code, the linter will complain because it cannot see the definition of the variable.

You can avoid this by reading the global variable explicitly from the window object, for example:

`const $ = window.$;`

### Adding bootstrap

With Bootstrap version 5, you also need to install `popper.js`.

Install

```javascript
npm i bootstrap@5.2.3 @popperjs/core
```

Use

```javascript
// /src/index.js
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js";
```

// Put any other imports below so that CSS from your components
// takes precedence over default styles.

### Making a Progressive Web App

If you start a new project using one of the PWA custom templates, you'll get a src/service-worker.js file that serves as a good starting point for an offline-first service worker:

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-pwa
````
