## Section 4.4: list files with shell's `filename expansion` and `brace expansion`:

- Display the files and dirs that are in cwd:(printf)
- display only the directories in the current directory
- display only (some) image files
- To capture a list of files into a variable for processing, it is typically good practice to use a 'bash array'
- Use the tree command's -L option to limit the display depth and the -d option to only list directories.
- The ls command's -S option sorts the files in descending order of file size. What heppens when used with '-r' option?

# Chapter 5: Using Cat
- What is the primary purpose of 'cat'?
- print lines numbers?
- Show TAB chars as ^|
- show linefeed(LF) chars as $
- Number nonempty output lines, override -n

> use `less` instead of `more`

- Ex. listing content backwards (from end to start)
- Ex. for using a `cat` to let you write the text on terminal to be saved in a file named `file`. (use `Ctrl+D` to end writing text on terminal)
- Ex. Using a here docment `<<END` to inline the contents of a file into a command line or a script. How to prevent `substitution`.
- give an ex. for add quoting to prevent the shell from performing command substitution and variable interpolation
- 5.4: use `cat` to see if there are any non-printable characters, or non-ASCII characters in `file.txt`.
- 5.5: what is the deference between `cat file.txt` and `cat < file.txt`? (in how read contents).
- Ex. print line numbers before each line and skip empty lines when counting lines.
- Ex. Concatenate gzipped files.(gzip/gunzip/cat)

### Terms:

**Spaces**

__In files/dirs names__
- A 'leading space' is defined as a space character at the beginning of a file or folder name. A file or folder with leading spaces occurs when the file/folder name begins with one or more spaces.
- A 'trailing space' is defined as a space character at the end of a file or folder name.

__In texts/lines__
- Leading spaces (at the start of the text), Trailing spaces (at the end of the text) and Non-Breaking spaces (prevents line breaks from occurring at a particular point)

**Non printable characters**

Non-printable characters are parts of a character set that do not represent a written symbol or part of the text within a document or code. Instead, they use to indicate a format actions such as:
 - White spaces (considered an invisible graphic)
 - Carriage returns
 - Tabs
 - Line breaks
 - Page breaks
 - Null characters
